# Reciplay_website
There have been times when even after having enough ingredients at home, we can't decide what to cook from them. This website called "Reciplay" is dedicated to solve this very problem using simple API fundamentals. Just enter the ingredients that you currently have and get random recipes, choose from them depending on your taste.
The API that is used here is Spoonacular API, which can educate people about the nutrition in the meals they have among many other uses like building a website like this one. :)  

Go ahead and read the documentation of [**Spoonacular API**](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). 
The number od requests to the API is limited so please be cautious while coding, i can wait for few days if you want t continue your work :smile:.

Below are the screenshots of current state of the website.
